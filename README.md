# Canopy example.  Thanks to: ADSA Fall 2017 Workshop: Python Series - Introduction to Machine Learning
Intro to Machine Learning using Jupyter/IPython notebook for the Association of Data Science and Analytics at UIUC.
 
## Example: Visualize genomic overlap of novel transcripts from 2 different stickleback brain regions (Diencephalon and Telencephalon)
* Download and install Enthought Canopy from here: https://store.enthought.com/downloads/
* download the python notebook and text file in this repository into a local folder: (https://github.com/jmtroy/canopy_example/blob/master/test_plots.ipynb and https://github.com/jmtroy/canopy_example/blob/master/max_overlap_from_diff_and_same_brain_region.txt )
* start canopy and open the python note book
* Then you can run the blocks in the notebook.  But be sure to update the file path to reflect where you downloaded the text file.

## The following are the notes from the ADSA workshop on Sunday Oct 15, 2017
